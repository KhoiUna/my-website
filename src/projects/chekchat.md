ChekChat was my 1st attempt to build a startup. You can try the {%newtab_link 'https://chekchat.khoiuna.info/' 'live demo'%} with these credentials or {%newtab_link 'https://chekchat.khoiuna.info/register' 'register'%} for one:

# Problem

Most team collaboration apps like Slack, Discord, Trello, etc. requires users to toggle between apps causing context switching.

- For example, developers use Trello to work on a task, then go to Slack to discuss &rarr; Users have to toggle between Slack and Trello &rarr; Causes context switching.

&rarr; Context switching distracts developers to work on tasks.

# Solution

Built an app that focused on tasks where users can chat in a room made for that specific task.

# Team

Worked in a team of three to build the app.

# Tech stack

Coded the front end with React/NextJS, Redux, and Material UI hosted on Vercel.

Built the back end with SocketIO and Express deployed to Heroku.

# Why we failed

Our team lost commitment over time due to not involving users in the process. Actually, we built before validating.

Seeing no validation was probably the biggest reason.
